= ISO 8583 Financial Messaging for Ruby

This package currently contains code for coding an decoding ISO 8583
Financial Message.

== PLEASE NOTE: PROJECT ABANDONDED ==

Currently, I do not have time to maintain this project properly. Everything was happy
in Ruby 1.8. Unfortunately with string encoding around 1.9 and later, dealing with
bytes has become fairly tedious in ruby. The existing tests no longer work, because for
some reason test/unit is no longer properly supported.

If anyone cares to bring the build/test/infrastructure up to "modern" ruby standard, please
do so. I don't have the time at the moment.

== Using

The best place to get started using the library is the documentation of the
Message class. Once a stable state is reached, this should be the only
class you need to use ...

== Installing

You can install the +iso8583+ package by executing:

	gem install iso8583

== Source

The source is most readily available on github[http://github.com/a2800276/8583].

== Mailing List

In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for
improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact
me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de).
