This package currently contains code for coding an decoding ISO 8583
Financial Message.


== Installing

Having a "Installing" section is a bit of a chicken or egg question.
Someone reading the README has, in all likelyhood already installed your
package. On the other hand, in case your project has a more involved
build process, it might be worthwhile to consider describing it in a
seperate INSTALL file.

It can't hurt to provide canonical instructions for installation,
though. You can install the +hello+ package by executing:

	gem install iso7816 -r

alternatively, you can download +.tar.gz+ or +.zip+ archives from 
Rubyforge[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1791].

== Source

The source is most readily available on github[http://github.com/a2800276/8583/], 
and there should usually be a more or less current version available
in the Rubyforge SVN repository.


== Mailing List

In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for
improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact
me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de).
